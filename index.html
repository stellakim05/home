<p >Hi, my name is Byeolha Kim, and I am 19 years old. I am a freshman pursuing my Information Systems Science and Engineering Course (ISSE) at Ritsumeikan University in Japan. I am originally from South Korea, and I have always been fascinated by the blend of tradition and modernity in my country and Japan. 
 </p>
          
          <p>I have a strong curiosity about technology and its impact on our world. I love exploring and creating things, and understanding how different systems work together to solve real-world problems. This curiosity led me to choose my current field of study, where I am excited to learn.

</p>
      
          <p>In addition to my academic interests, I have several hobbies, like studying Japanese, listening to music, and watching YouTube and Netflix. Before I came to Japan, I used to play drums. However because I had to enroll in university, I discontinued playing drums. During the summer break, I want to learn Chinese and learn how to play bass. 
 </p>      
      
      <p>Furthermore, I love spending time with my parents talking and doing fun activities. When I was young, on my birthdays, I used to go to waterparks with my mom and dad. However, now that my parents and I are busy, we cannot afford as much time together as before. Therefore, while I am in Korea, I want to spend more time with my parents.
